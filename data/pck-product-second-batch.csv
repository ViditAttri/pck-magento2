The machine has been designed with ease of cleaning in mind. The space between the blade and the head is easily accessible to enable regular cleaning. A quick release meat table makes removal easy.

50 cups (160ml), 10 litre capacity
The urns feature a unique mode selector switch that allows either variable or pre-set temperature control, providing ultimate flexibility and ease of use
With the mode set to variable, the temperature can be controlled across a wide range via the graduated knob. Variable mode will suit those users who require warm or boiling water for their special application
Switching the mode selector to pre-set will fix the temperature at 95°C, the optimal temperature for most applications involving tea or coffee. Using pre-set mode offers a fast and easy setup, achieving consistent temperatures every time. Adjustment of the knob in pre-set mode has no effect on the temperature setting of the urn - it remains constant at nominal 95°C. This prevents continuous boiling and excessive consumption of energy

CX876-A,APURO,APURO CX876-A,Apuro CX876-A Manual Fill Water Boiler 10L,"Heating water for teas and coffees can be very expensive, especially when energy prices are high. Whether you're running a charity, a church, a snack van or a café, the cost of boiling drinking water can really hit your bottom line, especially if demand is high.

The 10Ltr Apuro energy saving water boiler can make a real reduction in these costs. With its clever insulated double-walled stainless steel construction, the boiler can save you up to 60% on energy use in comparison to traditional single-skinned boilers. Not only does this save money - it reduces your environmental impact too.

The insulated design means the water gets up to serving temperature faster (around 6 minutes faster than non-insulated models) so you can start serving even sooner than before. It also provides less heat drop-off, so even when switched off, the water temperature only drops around 18°C over the course of two hours - a real example of the Apuro water boiler's impressive insulation.

The improvements to efficiency don't impact the performance or practicality of the water boiler at all - you still get all the great features you'd expect from Apuro professional water urns. From the heavy duty construction and easy-clean design, to the thermal safety cut-off, the boiler provides all the reliability, performance and day-to-day user-friendly operation you need to make every service a success.
