The machine has been designed with ease of cleaning in mind. The space between the blade and the head is easily accessible to enable regular cleaning. A quick release meat table makes removal easy.

50 cups (160ml), 10 litre capacity
The urns feature a unique mode selector switch that allows either variable or pre-set temperature control, providing ultimate flexibility and ease of use
With the mode set to variable, the temperature can be controlled across a wide range via the graduated knob. Variable mode will suit those users who require warm or boiling water for their special application
Switching the mode selector to pre-set will fix the temperature at 95°C, the optimal temperature for most applications involving tea or coffee. Using pre-set mode offers a fast and easy setup, achieving consistent temperatures every time. Adjustment of the knob in pre-set mode has no effect on the temperature setting of the urn - it remains constant at nominal 95°C. This prevents continuous boiling and excessive consumption of energy
